# ProjectTimer
## Description:
Simple C# app with multiple timers to track time spend on particular project or task.

## Motivation:
I found it difficult at one point to track the time spent all the projects I was working on and this idea came to mind.
Unfortunatly initial search on the internet I could not find anything that does what I wanted. 
Python console application didn't seem appropriate so I decided on C#.

## Functionalities:
Version 1.0.0:
- Uses WinForms
- Tracks time for 4 projects/tasks
- starting one timer pauses the others
- has one timer that continues to count to track the full time spent on all projects/tasks
- minimizes to tray
- has the option to pause all timers
- has the option to reset all timers
- has export function to export the times and project's/task's names as well as the total time to .txt file.

TODO list:
- change UI framework
- starting with one task, dynamically to create new ones.
- make some sort of installer
